<details>

<summary><strong>Myth 1. AI replaces engineering judgment</strong></summary>

**It does not.**

AI has no understanding of:

* Business context
* Risk tolerance
* Production impact
* Long-term maintainability

Engineering judgment remains non-negotiable.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Myth 2. AI makes bad engineers good</strong></summary>

**It does not.**

AI follows instructions.

* If your instructions are weak, unclear, or incorrect, AI will confidently produce bad results faster.

**AI amplifies skill. It does not create it.**

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Myth 3. AI automatically improves productivity</strong></summary>

**It does not.**

Unstructured AI usage often:

* Increases rework
* Introduces subtle bugs
* Creates false confidence

Productivity gains come from **changing workflows**, not from adding tools.

</details>

### What AI Actually Does Well

* Speeds up understanding of unfamiliar code
* Reduces boilerplate and repetitive work
* Assists with debugging and analysis
* Improves consistency in reviews, tests, and documentation

***

### What AI Does NOT Do

* Make architectural decisions for yourself
* Understand domain-specific business rules
* Guarantee correctness or safety
* Replace code review and validation
