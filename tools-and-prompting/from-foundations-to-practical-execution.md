# From Foundations to Practical Execution

Up to this point, we talked about **why AI must be used carefully**.

We established:

* AI is powerful but unreliable
* AI increases risk when used blindly
* Humans remain accountable for outcomes

**Now comes the real question:**

> **If AI is risky, how do good engineers still use it productively?**

The answer is not more rules.\
The answer is **controlled execution**.

This is where tools and prompting discipline matter.

In the next section, we move from **theory to practice**:

* How to use AI _inside_ your development workflow
* How to keep control while increasing speed
* How to avoid chaos when multiple AI tools are involved

We start with **Cursor** because it sits directly where engineers work.\
Inside the code.
