# Cursor

**First. Reframe Cursor Correctly**

You must say this clearly:

> Cursor is not “ChatGPT inside VS Code”.\
> Cursor is a **context-aware coding assistant with execution authority**.

If devs treat it like a chat box, they waste 70 percent of its value.

**Cursor’s power comes from:**

* Full repo awareness
* File-level diff generation
* Multi-step planning
* Agentic execution

Now we will explore the various modes available in Cursor, examining each one to understand properly and determine when to use which.

## Cursor Modes Explained. When to Use What

Cursor has **five core interaction modes** that matter in practice:

* [Ask](ask-mode.md)
* [Plan](plan-mode.md)
* [Agent](agent-mode.md)
* [Debug](debug-mode.md)
* [Browser (Web)](browser-web-mode.md)

Most developers randomly use them. That is wrong.
