# Conclusion

### How Tools Fit Together

Teach this workflow explicitly:

1. **Ask**
   * Understand code
   * Clarify intent
2. **Plan**
   * Decide approach
   * Identify risks
3. **Agent**
   * Execute changes
   * Generate boilerplate
4. **Browser**
   * Validate against external truth

If you jump directly to Agent, you are skipping the thinking process.

### What You Should Warn Them About (Non-negotiable)

Be direct here.

* Cursor will confidently generate wrong code
* It will follow bad instructions perfectly
* It will not understand your business context unless you provide it

Rules you should enforce:

* Never paste secrets
* Never trust generated auth logic blindly
* Never let AI define business rules alone

> Cursor does not replace engineering skill.\
> It **amplifies** it.\
> If your thinking is weak, Cursor will make your mistakes faster.
